* Raw data have been processed for in total <code>53,700</code> runs (samples), belonging to <code>282</code> projects.
* Among the processed data, microbe abundance data are available for in total <code>37,550</code> runs (samples), belonging to <code>209</code> projects.
* In total <code>16,150</code> runs (samples), belonging to <code>159</code> projects <code>failed our QC processes</code>.

In addition, <b><span style="color:darkblue">Mycobiome</span><span style="color:forestgreen">DB</span></b>
 also includes information on <code>76</code> projects whose raw data were not processed, including in total <code>31,381</code> runs/samples, due to various reasons, mostly the <code>lack of phenotype information</code>.

## Associated human diseases
