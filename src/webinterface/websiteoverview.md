# Website overview

## The Main / Home page

The main containts of the [home page](http://mycobiome.humangut.info/home) contain three main sections: 

### 1. brief summary of db contents

This sections contain:

* the main features of <b><span style="color:darkblue">Mycobiome</span><span style="color:forestgreen">DB</span></b>
* main contents of the database and links to the corresponding pages.

### 2. a disease marker genus network

This section contains a network of disease marker genera combined from all disease in <b><span style="color:darkblue">Mycobiome</span><span style="color:forestgreen">DB</span></b>. The circular nodes represent the marker genera of disease, whereas the pin-shaped nodes represent diseases themselves. The red edges indicate that the genus is enriched in disease, while the blue edges indicate enrichment in health.

<!-- ### 3. a graphic data selector

A graphic data selector that allows users to construct complex queries to the projects and runs in our database. It consists of two selectors, one is dedicated for searching for <code>samples/runs</code>, the other is for <code>projects</code>.

Below is a screenshot of the selector:

![](/assets/images/index/query_builder_example.png)

The search logic is to find <code>runs/samples</code> that are: 

* related to healthy individuals, <code>AND</code>,
* 18 to 25 years old, <code>AND</code>,
* with healthy BMI from 18.5 to 24.9.

See the [Database usage](../usage/graphicquirybuilder.md) section for details and more examples. -->

## Header bar / navigation bar

The header bar is fixed to the top so it is placed at the top of windows for navigation purposes. It contains two main sections:

<!-- See the screenshot below:

It displays a logo of <b><span style="color:darkblue">Mycobiome</span><span style="color:forestgreen">DB</span></b>. Users can click this logo and navigate back to the [home page](http://mycobiome.humangut.info/home).

### 2. Menu items / navigation items

This section contains menu and sub-menu items that allow users to navigate through the main contents of <b><span style="color:darkblue">Mycobiome</span><span style="color:forestgreen">DB</span></b>.
