# Identification of disease markers in curated projects

Please note this is an <code>ongoing effort</code> and the results are available for a limited number of projects; more projects will be added as the analysis go.

## Overview

Marker identification was performed for <code>curated projects</code> referred as 
[curated projects](http://mycobiome.humangut.info/data/curatedprojects) in 
<b><span style="color:darkblue">Mycobiome</span><span style="color:forestgreen">DB</span></b>
. These projects were selected based on the following criteria (of course in addition to availability of manpower and time):

* high-quality meta-data with clearly defined diseases and healthy controls,
* high-quality of data, and
* enough numbers of both cases and controls, usually more than 20 per group.

## Marker genus

A <code>marker genus</code> refers to a genus that showed significantly differential abundances between  cases vs. controls using 
[LEfSe (Linear discriminant analysis effect size)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21702898).

Marker genera were identified on a per-project basis. 

Please consult the ["All marker genera" page](http://mycobiome.humangut.info/taxon/marker) for more information.

## Curated projects

In <b><span style="color:darkblue">Mycobiome</span><span style="color:forestgreen">DB</span></b>
, manually curation was performed for selected projects in order to:

* select usable runs with clearly defined phenotype,
* group samples according to their corresponding phenotypes, and
* identify marker genera between disease vs. health comparisons.

In addition to the project metadata and run table, the project page also contains a list of samples manually curated, their diseases  and corresponding runs. Followed by marker genera identified from pairs of phenotypes (refers to as [phenotype comparisons](http://mycobiome.humangut.info/phenotypes/comparisons) in our database). Marker genera are shown in both table view and tile plot view.
