In order to further facilitate users to find data of interests, we equipped <b><span style="color:darkblue">Mycobiome</span><span style="color:forestgreen">DB</span></b> with
[a graphical query builder (data selector)](https://mycobiome.humangut.info/#/home) to help users to create complex and flexible queries with a few clicks. So far the data selector allows users to filter samples and runs by related technical meta data such as <code>experiment type (16S or Metagenomics)</code>, <code>number of sequenced reads</code>, and host- related meta data, including related phenotype (<code>disease or health</code>), <code>age</code>, <code>sex</code>, and <code>BMI (body mass index)</code>. More filters will be added in the future.
For example, the screenshot below allows users to search for samples (runs) that:

* were taken from healthy individuals with BMI (body mass index) over 25, <code>AND</code>
* were sequenced by either 16S <code>OR</code> metagenomics.
